# ChoreTrackerApp
The Chore Tracker App is a locally run task management system built with Java, Spring Boot, JavaFX, and a SQL-based backend. It allows household members to assign, track, and complete chores. Parents can assign tasks to children, monitor completion, and reward them, making everyday task management simple and efficient.
